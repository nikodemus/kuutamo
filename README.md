# Kuutamo

Kuutamo means *"moon appearing in the sky"* in Finnish. It is a small
project to explore modifications to the Pure Data software for the
Critter & Guitari 5 Moons looper.

Current version 0.1 has no intentional behavioral modifications from
the official stereo firmware - bugs may have been introduced!

Current version has been tested on PD Vanilla, running on Windows 11.

_UNTESTED ON THE ACTUAL 5 MOONS HARDWARE. BEWARE!_
